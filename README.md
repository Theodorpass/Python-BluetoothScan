# Python-BluetoothScan
This Python script uses the bleak library to scan for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It logs the details of each discovered device, including its name, address, and signal strength (RSSI). The script also handles errors gracefully and pauses before exiting, giving you time to review the output.
